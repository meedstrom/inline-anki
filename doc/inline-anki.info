1 Installation
**************

Not yet on (M)ELPA.  If you have straight.el
(https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el), you can install the
package with this initfile snippet:

     (use-package inline-anki
       :straight (inline-anki :type git :host github :repo "meedstrom/inline-anki"))

   Alternatively with Doom Emacs, this goes in ‘packages.el’:

     (package! inline-anki :recipe (:host github :repo "meedstrom/inline-anki"))

   Below, you’ll find a recommended config snippet for Org-mode.  It
lets you quickly create a ‘#+begin_flashcard’ block at point with the
C-c , key (‘org-insert-structure-template’).

     (with-eval-after-load 'org
       (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("f" . "flashcard")))

2.1 To push cards
=================

Your only direct interaction with this package is one command that you
would run every once in a while (weeks?  months?  depends on you) to
update the Anki database.

   To update the Anki database:

  1. Make sure Anki has the AnkiConnect add-on installed
  2. Make sure you have ‘curl’ installed
  3. Start Anki
  4. From your Org file, type ‘M-x inline-anki-push-notes-in-buffer RET’
        • Or push from all Org files in the current directory and its
          subdirectories, by typing ‘M-x
          inline-anki-push-notes-in-directory RET’

   You may like to know that:

   • When you upload a note, it overwrites that note in Anki.  *Any
     edits made inside Anki will be forgotten!*  The only thing Anki
     gets to remember about a note is the review schedule.

   • As a convenience, if you comment-out a note expression, the next
     push will tell Anki to suspend all the cards for that note.
        • If you later uncomment it, the next push will unsuspend them.
        • Note that you can still follow a workflow of suspending cards
          during your review sessions.  I consider it a psychological
          boon that Anki will forget these suspends on the next push,
          forcing you to revise all the bad notes you found before you
          can push again.
             • Just remember to look up the suspends inside Anki but
               edit in the corresponding source Org file.

   • There’s a bit of a gimmick: if a note has 3 clozes, and you study
     it a bit, and later you remove the first cloze, the second and
     third cloze cards will *inherit the scheduling of the first and
     second*.  So technically, you can have cards that aren’t scheduled
     faithfully to the algorithm, and failure statistics _may_ be
     referring to a cloze card that you’ve removed.
        • Up to you whether to care, but in my opinion, it changes
          nothing in practice.
        • No surprise to experienced Anki-users, but the third field’s
          original scheduling will be attached to an empty card.
          Remember that you can clean up empty cards with the menu
          option “Check database...”.

2.2 Config variables
====================

   • ‘inline-anki-deck’
        • Default “Default”.

   • ‘inline-anki-note-type’
        • Default “Cloze from Outer Space”.

   • ‘inline-anki-emphasis-type’
        • Default “_”, can be changed to “*”, “/” or other things you
          find in ‘org-emphasis-alist’.

   • ‘inline-anki-send-tags’
        • Default ‘nil’.  Controls whether or not to send Org tags to
          Anki.  Can also be a whitelist of valid tags like ‘("tag1"
          "tag2")’ or a blacklist of invalid tags like ‘(not "tag1"
          "tag2")’.  Value ‘t’ sends all tags.
        • The benefit of a ‘nil’ value is faster upload if you have
          hundreds of Org files.

   • ‘inline-anki-ignore-file-regexps’
        • Helps the command ‘inline-anki-push-notes-in-directory’ decide
          whether or not to visit a file.  If that file’s full name
          matches one of the regular expressions in this list, skip the
          file.

   • ‘inline-anki-fields’
        • See docstring.

2.3 Warning
===========

You must not *hard-wrap* your text (e.g.  with ‘fill-paragraph’) if you
want Anki to receive the whole flashcard.

2.4 Open in Emacs
=================

It would be convenient if you could click a link in Anki to open the
corresponding Org file in Emacs.

   By default, ‘inline-anki-fields’ ships an extra field for the
filename.  With addons such as
<https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/879473266>, it should be possible to
jump from Anki to Emacs using emacsclient.  Instructions TBD.

2.5 Mass-editing
================

If you switch ‘inline-anki-emphasis-type’ to bold or italic, remember to
*edit all the cards you had written*!

   Tips:

   • To search the current buffer for flashcards, type ‘M-x
     inline-anki-occur RET’.

   • To search every file in the directory, type ‘M-x inline-anki-rgrep
     RET’.
        • Then you can edit all at once with wgrep
          (http://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep) or a keyboard
          macro, for example.
             • The wgrep method won’t cut it for multiline flashcards,
               as you’ll see, but if you don’t have many of those, you
               could simply hand-edit each.  If you have many, learn to
               keyboard-macro.

File: inline-anki.info,  Node: Permanent limitations,  Next: Limitations vs anki-editor/org-anki,  Up: Implementation notes

3.1 Permanent limitations
=========================

There are *three flaws* which will never go away:

   • *Flaw 1:* Like anki-editor, inline-anki does not let you review
     inside Emacs.  You have to whip out your phone and review there, in
     your Anki app (or the desktop app, but who does that).

        • To me this is a non-issue since the bus is the only place I
          want to review anyway.

   • *Flaw 2:* Like with anki-editor, your Org files hold the “master
     copy” of each flashcard: *you cannot edit the cards from within
     Anki*.  If you tried, such edits would be lost on next sync.

     You have to return to your computer and edit there, in Emacs.

        • This means you can’t make small corrections on-the-fly while
          reviewing.

          Bit annoying, yes, but two-way sync is a notoriously finicky
          dev challenge so if such a feature was present, users would
          run into sync conflicts and nobody wants to deal with that.

        • Fortunately, this is less of a problem for us than for regular
          Anki users, since the flashcards are serving double duty as
          body text.  You will be able to see and refine the text of the
          flashcard at your leisure, in contrast with other SRS when you
          only see it during review.

   • *Flaw 3:* The note format is constrained – you can’t express every
     kind of flashcard possible in Anki.

        • For me this is a good trade, if that means the flashcards stay
          in my life.  Until now, they never stayed long due to clumsy
          workflows.  Better simple flashcards than no flashcards at
          all.

3.2 Limitations vs. anki-editor/org-anki
========================================

Many traditional features are ABSENT in inline-anki.

   • It uses only one deck
   • It uses only one note type (cloze)
   • It clozes only one deletion at a time
   • You cannot set tags on a per-note basis
        • The note will still inherit tags from the Org subtree
             • Note that Anki tags lose much of their organizational
               purpose if all your notes live in Org files anyway –
               you’ll be organizing from within org-roam
               (https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) or whichever
               system you have, not from within Anki.  However, at least
               two use-cases remain:
                  • You can display the tags inside cards as a
                    contextual hint, if you code this in the card
                    template
                    (https://edstrom.dev/posts/qix2Q4W/how-to-display-tags-as-hint-in-all-anki-cards)
                  • You can use the tags to set up Custom Study sessions
                    on a filtered subset of notes
                       • Invaluable since we dump all notes into one
                         deck
             • Finally, even if you leave ‘inline-anki-send-tags’ at
               nil, inline-anki always attaches one tag named after the
               sync date, in this style: “from-emacs-2023-09-20”
                  • This tag lets you separate inline-anki notes from
                    your “handmade” notes
                  • This tag lets you see if you have stale inline-anki
                    notes that aren’t being updated (perhaps because you
                    deleted them from the source)
   • You get no indication in Emacs that Anki has flagged a card as
     “Marked” or “Leech”
        • You can still see this in Anki’s own card browser, so you can
          still sit down and go through them manually every now and then
          – just like a normal Anki user, with the difference that when
          you see something that needs to change, you have to open the
          source file in Emacs and edit there.

3.3 Syntax of a flashcard
=========================

   • To identify a flashcard, inline-anki looks for one of the following
     things:
        • A magic string at the *start of a list item*: ‘@anki’.
             • When Anki assigns it an ID, this will become a @ glyph
               followed by a 13-digit number in superscript, such as
               ‘@^{1693535436701}’.
        • A magic string at the *end of a line*: ‘@anki’ OR ‘^{anki}’.
             • Same as above, except that you can omit the @ glyph.
                  • Since the ‘@anki’ form is easier to remember and
                    easier to type, I suggest you just always type that
                    and remove the glyph later where you think its
                    absence looks better.
        • A structure template named ‘#+begin_flashcard’.
             • When Anki assigns it an ID, it becomes something like
               ‘#+begin_flashcard 1693535436702’.

   • Clozes are marked by underline text.  If you prefer bold or italic,
     configure ‘inline-anki-emphasis-type’.
        • If necessary, you can write Anki’s own ‘{{c1::}}’ syntax
          directly.  Best I can tell, it’s mainly useful for writing
          math equations.  However that makes the source
          unreadable/ugly, so you may as well do math in Anki only for
          now.

4 Q&A
*****

   • Can I continue using my [org-drill/org-anki/...] cards?
        • Yes!  Those packages treat whole Org subtrees as their “data
          objects”, and this package does not.  You can even have an
          inline-anki card _inside_ an org-anki subtree.
